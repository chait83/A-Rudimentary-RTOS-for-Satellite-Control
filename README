_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

This is the integrated system software for the control of a small satellite designed by COEP
students. It is an example of how moderately complex systems are built on Bare Metal. 

This contains the following code:

app:
bob_tasks.c	- Bunch of rudimentary tasks performed by the system

asm:		- All output of `make asm' goes here

device:		- On chip device drivers
driver_pio.c		- Parallel IO port
rtt.c			- Real Time Timer
sd.c			- SD card
spi.c			- Serial peripheral interface
usart.c			

ecc:		- Code for error correction coding on program memory
hamming2.s		- Hamming code
scrubs.s		- Data scrubbing

fs:		- A simple File System that is used on the SD card
patches
sat_fs.c
spi_fs.h.bak
test_main.c

fs/patches:	
20.10.10.patch
sat_fs.c

include:		
AT91SAM7X256.h		- Atmel header for MCU
bob_tasks.h			
driver_pio.h
rtt.h
sat_fs.h
sd.h
spi.h
SST_config.h		- Configuration file
task.h
trace.h
usart.h

system:
boot.s			- Bootup code. 
exc.c			- High level Interrupt Service Routines. Also contains some code to help the
			  scheduler
exceptions.s		- Low level exception handlers
low_level_init.c	- First hardware initialisation
swi.c			- Software interrupts - a rudimentary system calls interface
task.c			- Real time scheduler
